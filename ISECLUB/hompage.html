    <p><i>A student’s life is no less than a rollercoaster. In addition to learning new skills and exploring various opportunities, a student has a lot to deal with in terms of assignments, practicals, exams, internships, workshops, lectures, and much more, essential to ensure optimum academic development. Amidst the busy schedule, it is very important to take a break to refresh oneself. This is where extracurricular activities play a vital role. These activities, during college life, keep you positive, fresh, energetic and go a long way in making you more productive.</i></p>
